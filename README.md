Dash Cheat Sheets 
===========

All of Dash's cheat sheets can be found in this repo. You can modify them or add new ones using pull requests.

# Make Your Own

Cheat sheets are generated using [cheatset](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset#readme). Check out cheatset's [README](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset#readme) for instructions on how to make your own cheat sheet.

To modify an existing cheet sheet, simply fork this repo and look inside the "cheatsheets" folder. The [format](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset#readme) used to define a cheat sheet is quite simple, so don't be afraid to jump right in.
